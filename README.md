If you read this, you're **cool**.

I appreciate you reading this instead of playing video games.

Really.

Actually, you should go play something instead.

Nothing fun to see here.

Seriously.

Don't you have anything more important to do?

If you're still here, plug this into `gcc` and dm me if you know what it is ;)
```C++
int main(n){float r,i,R,I,b;for(i=-1;i<1;i+=.06,puts(""))for(r=-2;I=i,(R=r)<1;
r+=.03,putchar(n+31))for(n=0;b=I*I,26>n++&&R*R+b<4;I=2*R*I+i,R=R*R-b+r);}
```
