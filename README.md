If you read this, you're **cool**.

I appreciate you reading this instead of playing video games.

*Really*.

Actually, you should go play something instead.

Nothing fun to see here.

Seriously.

Don't you have anything more important to do?

If you're still here, plug this into `gcc` ;)
```C++
int main(n){float r,i,R,I,b;for(i=-1;i<1;i+=.06,puts(""))for(r=-2;I=i,(R=r)<1;
r+=.03,putchar(n+31))for(n=0;b=I*I,26>n++&&R*R+b<4;I=2*R*I+i,R=R*R-b+r);}
```
